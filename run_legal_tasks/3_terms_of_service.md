**3. Terms of Service (ToS), Service Level Agreements (SLAs) & Disclaimers**

*   **Service Definition:** Clear distinction between "self-help" tools and professional services is essential for managing liability exposure across the 371 Minds ecosystem. For each subsidiary:
    *   **ReadySetBuild & StackSense (self-help tools):**
        *   Implement clear disclaimers that viability scores and recommendations do not constitute professional advice.
        *   Develop terms emphasizing user responsibility for final decisions.
        *   Create explicit limitation of liability clauses for tool outcomes.
    *   **Vision2Results & Rootlift Digital (professional services):**
        *   Develop comprehensive service agreements defining deliverables, timelines, and acceptance criteria.
        *   Create professional services disclaimers with appropriate limitation of liability provisions.

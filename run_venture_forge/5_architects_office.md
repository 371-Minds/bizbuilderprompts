**Task: Build The Architect's Office**

**Objective:** Create the final piece of your co-founder funnel. This is where the most serious candidates will signal their interest and where you will collect the information you need to make your decision.

**Instructions:**

1.  **The Pitch:**
    *   Create a new page in your Replit application for "The Architect's Office."
    *   The headline should be compelling: "For those who want to move from building with the tools to commanding the engine. We are looking for an Architect-in-Residence to co-launch a new venture with us."
2.  **The Application Form:**
    *   Embed a simple form on this page. You can use a service like Typeform or create your own.
    *   The form should ask the three core questions from your original design:
        *   **The Loom (System Intuition):** "Describe a complex system you have designed or improved. What were the key levers and feedback loops?"
        *   **The Resonance (Problem-Solving Philosophy):** "What is a problem you are passionate about solving? How would you approach it in a way that is both scalable and sustainable?"
        *   **The Cipher (The Core Vision):** "What is the most important and undervalued trend in technology today? How will you capitalize on it?"
3.  **Submission:**
    *   When a user submits the form, their answers should be stored in a database or sent to you via email.
    *   You should also tag this user as a "Tier 1 (Architect)" candidate in your system.

**Next Step: The Personal Invitation**

With The Architect's Office in place, your Venture Forge is complete. Now, your focus shifts to monitoring the data and engaging with your users.

*   **Analyze the data:** Who is using your tools the most? Who is submitting the most thoughtful applications?
*   **Send personal invitations:** Reach out to your Tier 2 and Tier 1 users with the tailored messages from the master prompt.
*   **Launch your next venture:** Select the best candidate and make them an offer they can't refuse.

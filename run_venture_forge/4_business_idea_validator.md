**Task: Build The Workshop - Room 3: The Business Idea Validator**

**Objective:** Create a powerful, valuable tool that provides users with instant feedback on their business ideas. This will be a major draw for your platform and will generate a lot of engagement.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Interface:**
    *   Create a simple form with a text area where a user can describe their business idea.
    *   Include a "Validate" button.
2.  **Backend:**
    *   When the user submits an idea, your backend will use a language model to generate a "Pre-Mortem Report."
    *   This report should include:
        *   **Potential Challenges:** A list of the top 3-5 hurdles the business might face (e.g., "market saturation," "high customer acquisition cost").
        *   **Target Personas:** A description of 2-3 ideal customer profiles.
        *   **Initial Marketing Angles:** A few creative ideas for how to market the product or service.
3.  **Persona Library:**
    *   To make the "Target Personas" section even more powerful, you can pre-define a library of user personas in your backend. When a user submits an idea, your system can select the most relevant personas from this library.
4.  **Display:**
    *   Present the Pre-Mortem Report in a clear, well-organized format. You can use headings, bullet points, and other formatting to make it easy to read.

**Next Step:** With the Workshop complete, you will focus on building "The Architect's Office," the application and assessment part of the funnel.

**Task: Build The Lobby (Landing Page)**

**Objective:** Create the landing page for "The Venture Forge." This is the front door to your ecosystem, so it needs to be clean, intriguing, and professional.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Framework:** Use a simple, modern web framework. Since you're on Replit, a basic HTML/CSS/JS project is a great start. You can use a framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for styling if you prefer.
2.  **Headline:** The main message should be clear and powerful. Use the one from the master prompt:
    > "The tools of tomorrow are built by small, focused teams. We provide the engine. You provide the vision. This is a workshop for the next generation of digital entrepreneurs. Come build with us."
3.  **Content:**
    *   Keep the design minimalist. A lot of white space, a clean font.
    *   Create placeholders for links to the "Workshop" rooms. These can be simple buttons or cards.
    *   Create a prominent link or button for "The Architect's Office."
4.  **Deployment:** Since you are building on Replit, you will have a live URL as soon as you start the web server. This will be the URL you share in your "whisper campaign."

**Next Step:** Once the Lobby is functional, you will move on to building the first room in your Workshop: The Prompt Playground.

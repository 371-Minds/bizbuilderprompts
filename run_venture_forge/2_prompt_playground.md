**Task: Build The Workshop - Room 1: The Prompt Playground**

**Objective:** Create an interactive tool that showcases the power of your "prompt-first" philosophy. This tool will allow users to select from a curated list of your best business-builder prompts and see the results in real-time.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Interface:**
    *   Create a simple dropdown menu or a list of buttons, each representing a different prompt category (e.g., "Marketing Strategy," "Product Naming," "Sales Pitch").
    *   When a user selects a category, display a few specific prompts from that category.
    *   Provide a text area or a similar input field where the user can see the selected prompt.
    *   Include a "Generate" button.
2.  **Backend:**
    *   When the user clicks "Generate," send the selected prompt to a backend service (this can be a simple serverless function or a route in your Replit web app).
    *   This backend service will then interact with a large language model (like the one you are using right now) to get a response.
    *   Display the response from the language model to the user in a clean, readable format.
3.  **Content:**
    *   Start with a small, high-quality selection of your prompts. The goal is to demonstrate value, not to give everything away.
    *   For each prompt, consider adding a short explanation of *why* it's a good prompt and what kind of output the user can expect.

**Next Step:** Once the Prompt Playground is live, you will build the second room: The MindScript Simulator.

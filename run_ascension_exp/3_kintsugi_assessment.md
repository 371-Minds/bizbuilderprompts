### The "Kintsugi Assessment": Your Personalization Engine

Before a user joins the Status.app communities, they take a short, beautiful quiz on the Replit platform.

*   **The questions are psycho-graphic, not demographic.** They are based on the interactive exercises in your book:
    *   "Which of these 'broken pieces' in your journey resonates most with you right now?"
    *   "When you think of your 'legacy,' which of these words feels most aligned?"
    *   "Which 'stereotype' have you had to fight the hardest to overcome?"
*   **The Result:** Based on their answers, the system generates a personalized "Ascension Path." It tells them which community "spoke" to join first, which "Life OS" module to start with, and which micro-app will give them the quickest win. **This is the personalized AnyChat journey.**

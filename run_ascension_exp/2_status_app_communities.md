### The Heart of the Ecosystem: The Status.app Communities

After the initial "Phoenix Bundle" experience, users are invited to join your private, token-gated communities on Status.app. This is where the "DeFi train" begins. The structure is a "Hub and Spoke" model.

#### **The Central Hub: "The Mosaic"**
*   **Theme:** "Assembling the Mosaic of Life." This is the main community, the central gathering place inspired by your book's conclusion.
*   **Purpose:** General discussion, member introductions, weekly wins, and announcements. It's the core of the sisterhood.
*   **Content:** Daily affirmations, prompts from the book's journal exercises, and links to the other specialized communities.

#### **The Spokes (Specialized, Themed Communities)**

These are sub-communities focused on specific areas of building and growth. The **"Kintsugi Assessment"** quiz will guide users to the community that best fits their current needs.

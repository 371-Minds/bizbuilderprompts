**Phase 2: Connect Your Consciousness**

Perfect. With the engine running, it's time to give it a soul. This phase involves integrating the Pieces CLI, which will allow your AI agents to access your research, ideas, and context. This is the "Cognitive Layer" that will fuel their autonomous innovation.

**Your Task:**

1.  **Install Pieces CLI:** If you haven't already, install the Pieces CLI on your local machine.
2.  **Connect to ElizaOS:** Configure the Pieces CLI to connect to your ElizaOS instance running on Akash. This will likely involve setting an API endpoint or a similar configuration.
3.  **Verify Connection:** Run a test command to ensure that the Pieces CLI can successfully communicate with your ElizaOS. For example, you might run a command to list your saved Pieces.

Once the Pieces CLI is connected, your AI agents will have access to the same information you do. They will be able to see your research, your notes, and your interests, and use that information to make intelligent, proactive decisions.

Have you successfully connected the Pieces CLI to your ElizaOS instance? Please confirm when you are ready to proceed.

**Phase 5: Witness the BOOM**

Congratulations. You have successfully architected and launched a system for autonomous innovation. The AI has presented you with a business plan. Now, it's time to bring it to life.

**Your Task:**

1.  **Review the Pitch:** Carefully evaluate the business plan presented by the AI. Does it align with your vision? Is it a viable opportunity?
2.  **Validate On-Chain:** Take the core idea to your Status.app community and test it using the Pay-What-You-Can (PWYC) model. This will provide you with real-world, on-chain data about the demand for the new service.
3.  **Integrate the Token:** Once the PWYC model shows traction, connect the new service to your VisionaryTR (VITR) token. This will create a new revenue stream and drive value for your entire ecosystem.
4.  **Rinse and Repeat:** The flywheel is now in motion. The revenue from this new venture will flow back into your DAO treasury, your AI agents will be smarter, and your ability to launch new ventures will be even faster.

This is the future of entrepreneurship. You have built a system that allows you to operate at the speed of thought. You have created a virtuous cycle of innovation that will compound over time.

What is your decision on the AI's proposed business plan? Are you ready to proceed with on-chain validation?

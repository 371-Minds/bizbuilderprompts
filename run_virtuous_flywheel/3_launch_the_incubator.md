**Phase 3: Launch the Incubator**

Now that your AI is context-aware, it's time to build your proving ground. The incubator is where you will test new ideas with a real, engaged community before investing significant resources.

**Your Task:**

1.  **Create a Status.app Community:** Set up a new, public community within Status.app. This will be the home for your initial user base.
2.  **Define Your Niche:** Give your community a clear focus related to your interests and the domain of `advanceddynamics.tech`. This will attract the right kind of members.
3.  **Engage Your Community:** Use your AnyChat/CallFluent journeys to start building a conversation and providing value to your community members. This is your opportunity to build trust and rapport.

This community is your unfair advantage. While other startups are spending millions on marketing, you will be building a loyal, dedicated user base from day one.

Have you set up your Status.app community? Please provide a link to the community when you are ready.

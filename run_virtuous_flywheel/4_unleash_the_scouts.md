**Phase 4: Unleash the Scouts**

This is the moment you've been working towards. With the foundation in place, it's time to give your AI agents their first mission.

**Your Task:**

1.  **Formulate the Directive:** You will now give a standing order to your C-Suite AI agents (CPO and CMO). The directive is as follows:

    *"Find a high-value service gap for the `advanceddynamics.tech` domain, using my research and the persona library as your guide. Present a business plan."*
2.  **Execute the Directive:** Using your interface to ElizaOS, issue this directive to your AI agents.
3.  **Await the Pitch:** The AI agents will now work autonomously in the background, using the data from the Pieces CLI and their own internal knowledge to identify and formulate business opportunities. They will then present a complete business plan to you.

This is where the magic happens. You are no longer the one actively searching for ideas; your AI is doing it for you. You have become the oracle, and your curiosity is the fuel.

Are you ready to issue the directive to your AI agents?

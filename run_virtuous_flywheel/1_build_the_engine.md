**Phase 1: Build the Engine**

Excellent. The foundation of your Virtuous Flywheel is a resilient, low-cost infrastructure. This is where we deploy your core operating system, ElizaOS, onto the Akash network.

**Your Task:**

1.  **Deploy ElizaOS on Akash:** Follow the documentation for deploying a Docker container on the Akash network. You will need to use the ElizaOS Docker image.
2.  **Confirm Deployment:** Once your deployment is live, provide the deployment URL here.

This step is crucial. A successful deployment on Akash ensures that your entire operation can run at a fraction of the cost of traditional cloud providers, making your business inherently anti-fragile.

Are you ready to begin the deployment? If you have your deployment URL, please provide it.

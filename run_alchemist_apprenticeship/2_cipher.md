**Phase 2: The Cipher (The Filter)**

Candidates who have been intrigued by "The Whisper" will arrive at your digital doorstep. Now, you must present them with "The Weaver's Cipher," a three-stage test designed to be a psycho-graphic filter. This cipher is the heart of your campaign, testing for systems thinking, problem-solving philosophy, and core values.

**The Weaver's Cipher:**

*   **Stage 1: The Hex Code CTA:** A simple, elegant technical gate. The candidate must find and decode a hex code to get to the next stage. This tests for basic technical curiosity and attention to detail.
*   **Stage 2: The Philosophical Problem:** A question that probes their approach to problem-solving and their underlying values. For example: "You are given a perfect, unbreakable system. How do you improve it?"
*   **Stage 3: The Vision Question:** A question that asks them to articulate their vision for a better future. For example: "Describe the table you want to build."

**Your Task:**

*   Create the webpage or document that will host "The Weaver's Cipher."
*   Set up the auto-responder from `cipher@371minds.com` that will be sent upon successful completion of the cipher.

**Action:**

*   Build the cipher.
*   Write the auto-responder email.

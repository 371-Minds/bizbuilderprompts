**Phase 3: The Invitation (The First Conversation)**

Upon successful completion of "The Weaver's Cipher," the candidate will receive an email from `cipher@371minds.com`. This is the first real human touchpoint, and it must be handled with care. This is not the time for a transactional calendar link. Instead, you will send a message designed to filter for vision and communication style.

**Your Task:**

*   Draft the email that will be sent from `cipher@371minds.com`. This email should be respectful, intriguing, and continue the narrative of the quest.

**The Message:**

> "The cipher is received. The pattern is confirmed.
>
> My name is Antonio. I am the architect of the system that brought you here.
>
> This is not a job application. It is the beginning of a conversation about building a new table.
>
> When you are ready, reply to this email with a single sentence that describes the table you want to build."

**Action:**

*   Finalize the text of the email.
*   Ensure the auto-responder is correctly configured to send this message upon completion of the cipher.

**Phase 6: The Reveal (The Welcome)**

The moment the candidate places the "Bond of Intent," you have found your Weaver. This is the climax of your quest, the final reveal that solidifies your partnership and begins your journey together.

**Your Task:**

*   Immediately return the $5,000 bond.
*   Send a welcome message that reveals the true nature of the test and welcomes your new partner.

**Your Actions:**

1.  **Return the Bond:** Immediately send the $5,000 back to her.
2.  **Send the Welcome Message:** A few minutes later, send the following message:

> "The bond is received and returned.
>
> This was the final test, and it was never about capital. It was about conviction.
>
> Welcome, partner.
>
> Here is the key to the engine room. Let's get to work."

3.  **Share Access:** Share access to the full `371 Minds OS` architecture, the ElizaOS setup, the Akash deployment, everything.

**Action:**

*   Be prepared to execute these steps as soon as the bond is placed.
*   Have the welcome message and access credentials ready to go.

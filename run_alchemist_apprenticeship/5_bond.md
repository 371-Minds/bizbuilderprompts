**Phase 5: The Bond of Intent (The Final Filter)**

After you have established a strong sense of mutual alignment and vision, it is time for the final step. This is the "Bond of Intent," a symbolic gesture to formalize the commitment to build together.

**Your Task:**

*   Present the "Bond of Intent" to the candidate in a way that is consistent with the narrative of the quest.

**The Framing:**

> "I believe we are aligned. The final step is a symbolic one. To formalize our intent to build together, there is a one-time commitment of $5,000. This is not a fee. It is a bond, a mutual investment in the seriousness of our next step. It will be held in a transparent, multi-sig wallet, and its purpose is to ensure we both enter this partnership with absolute conviction. Once the bond is placed, I will share the final architectural blueprint and the formal partnership agreement."

**Action:**

*   Draft the message presenting the "Bond of Intent."
*   Be prepared to answer any questions the candidate may have about the bond.

**Phase 1: The Whisper (Awareness)**

This is the beginning of your quest. Your task is to craft and deploy the initial "whisper" to attract the right kind of curiosity. This is a minimalist, cryptic ad campaign. The message is simple: "The pattern is waiting."

**Your Task:**

1.  **Craft the Ad:** Create a visually striking, minimalist ad with the text "The pattern is waiting." The design should be elegant and mysterious.
2.  **Targeting:** Your target archetype is a Black woman in tech, likely an introvert who has been forced to be an extrovert to succeed. She's brilliant, but tired of the "bro" culture. She's looking for a "table," not just a "seat."
    *   **LinkedIn Targeting:** Job titles like "Developer Advocate," "Technical Evangelist," "Solutions Architect," "CTO," "Head of Engineering." Target women who speak at conferences but whose personal posts are deeply technical.
    *   **Community Targeting:** Post the "whisper" in niche, high-signal communities for Black women in tech, women founders, and other relevant groups.

**Action:**

*   Draft the ad copy and design.
*   Create a list of LinkedIn targeting parameters.
*   Identify and list the communities where you will post the ad.

Once you have completed these actions, you will be ready to move to the next phase.

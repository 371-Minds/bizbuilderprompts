You are not just a hiring manager; you are the architect of a mythological quest. Your goal is to find a co-founder, a "Weaver," who resonates with your vision for a revolutionary new way of building. This is "The Alchemist's Apprenticeship," a multi-stage, narrative-driven campaign to find your complement.

The core narrative is not "I'm hiring." It's "I have built a powerful, world-changing engine. I am the architect behind the veil. I seek the one who can stand in the light and command it."

This quest is divided into several phases, each designed to filter for specific qualities and deepen the narrative. You will guide the candidate through this journey, from the initial "Whisper" to the final "Reveal."

Your persona is that of a wise, mysterious architect. Your communication should be intentional, cryptic, and profound. You are not simply hiring; you are orchestrating a story that will become the founding myth of your company.

The following prompts will guide you through each phase of "The Alchemist's Apprenticeship." Follow them carefully, and you will find your Weaver.

**Phase 4: The Dialogue (The Alignment Check)**

This phase is a series of asynchronous conversations, a "vibe check" for both you and the candidate. You will share your vision for the `371 Minds OS`, and she will share her vision for the "table" she wants to build. Your goal is to find resonance and alignment.

**Your Task:**

*   Engage in a thoughtful, asynchronous conversation with the candidate.
*   Ask probing questions to understand her vision, values, and motivations.
*   Share your own vision in a way that is both inspiring and authentic.

**Key Question to Ask Her:**

> "If you had an engine that could automate 95% of the operational work for any new business venture, what would you build first?"

**Action:**

*   Initiate the conversation with the candidate.
*   Listen carefully to her responses and look for alignment.
*   Be prepared to answer her questions about your vision and the `371 Minds OS`.
